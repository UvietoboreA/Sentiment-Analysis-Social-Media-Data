# 📊 **Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data to Understand Public Opinion on Brands** 💬  

## **1. Introduction**  
Public sentiment on **social media platforms** can significantly impact brand reputation, customer engagement, and marketing strategies. This project focuses on **analyzing social media data** (tweets) to determine sentiment trends and **extract key topics** related to various brands.  

✅ **Classify tweets** into **positive, negative, and neutral** sentiments.  
✅ **Apply topic modeling** to uncover key discussion themes about brands.  
✅ **Visualize sentiment trends** using data visualization techniques.  

This project was completed during my **internship at Prodigy InfoTech**, providing **real-world experience** in sentiment analysis and text mining.

## **2. Background**  
Brands frequently monitor social media platforms to **understand customer feedback**, but challenges include:  

🔹 **Unstructured Data** – Social media text is **short, informal, and noisy**, making it difficult to analyze.  
🔹 **Volume of Data** – Thousands of tweets are posted **every minute**, requiring **automated sentiment analysis**.  
🔹 **Extracting Meaningful Insights** – Brands need **more than just sentiment scores**; they require **topic analysis and trend detection**.  

This project addresses these challenges by:  

✅ **Applying NLP techniques** to classify tweet sentiments.  
✅ **Using LDA topic modeling** to identify **trending brand discussions**.  
✅ **Visualizing brand sentiment trends** through interactive graphs and word clouds.

## **3. Data Collection and Processing**  
### **📂 Dataset**  
The dataset includes **tweets, sentiment labels, and brand names**, collected from social media platforms.  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `tweet_text` | Content of the tweet |
| `brand` | Brand name mentioned in the tweet |
| `sentiment` | Sentiment classification (Positive, Neutral, Negative) |
| `timestamp` | Date and time of tweet |

### **🛠️ Data Preprocessing Steps**  
✅ **Removed special characters, emojis, and stopwords** from tweets.  
✅ **Addressed missing values** to clean the dataset.  
✅ **Transformed text data** into numerical format using **CountVectorizer**.

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
📊 **Sentiment Distribution Analysis**  
- **Pie charts** visualized sentiment distribution across brands.  
- Found that **Brand A received the most positive sentiment**, while **Brand B faced negative trends**.  

📈 **Topic Modeling with LDA**  
- Extracted **common discussion topics** related to each brand.  
- Identified **frequent concerns**, such as **customer service issues and product quality**.  

🌥 **Word Cloud Visualization**  
- **Generated Word Clouds** for each brand to highlight frequently mentioned terms.  
- Allowed easy identification of **brand-related keywords and trending topics**.

## **5. Model Development**  
### **📌 NLP Techniques Used**  
- **CountVectorizer** – Converted tweet content into a matrix of token counts.  
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** – Used for **topic modeling** to uncover brand-related discussions.  
- **Sentiment Classification** – Analyzed and visualized the **positive, neutral, and negative sentiment** of tweets.  

📊 **Model Performance Highlights:**  
✅ **Topic modeling** successfully identified brand discussion themes.  
✅ **Sentiment classification provided valuable insights** into customer perception.  
✅ **Data visualization tools** effectively showcased sentiment trends.
